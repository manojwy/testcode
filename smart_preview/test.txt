OAuth mail providers (Google) - Sending mails needs permission to send mail
which we don't have today. We will prompt user of this when the first mail
by existing users is sent. We could also attempt getting this auth in CM3
itself, or in onboarding of CM4

Not required, we have oauth for sending mails. It was a mistake we took
oauth for both(imap+smtp) from day one, now it came in handy.
